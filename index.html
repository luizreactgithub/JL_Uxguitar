      Yngwie Johann Malmsteen (born Lars Johan Yngve Lannerb√§ck, June 30, 1963) is a virtuoso guitarist / neo-classical metal artist from Sweden who achieved
     widespread acclaim in the 1980s for his technical proficiency and fusion of classical music elements with heavy rock guitar.

    <h2 id="t_2">
      Known for his virtuosity and style, Steve Vai has had a long and enviable career as a guitarist, singer, composer, and producer. The 1979 Berklee College of Music graduate, who began playing

    <h1 id="type_1">Hard Rock</h1>
    <h2 id="t_1">
      Hard rock is characterized by an emphasis on bluesy guitar riffs, powerful vocals, 
      and heavy, thunderous drums. In order to understand what makes a subgenre like hard rock meaningful, we must understand the other genres that contrast it.
    </h2>

    <h1 id="type_2">Heavy Metal</h1>
    <h2 id="t_2">
      Heavy metal is traditionally characterized by loud distorted guitars, emphatic rhythms, 
      dense bass-and-drum sound and vigorous vocals. Heavy metal subgenres variously emphasize, alter or omit one or more of these attributes.
    </h2>
   
    
    <h1 id="type_3">NeoClassic</h1>   
    <h2 id="t_3">
      Neoclassical guitar playing is a style that draws on classical music traditions while incorporating elements of rock and m
      etal music. It often features fast, technically demanding playing, intricate arpeggios, and a focus on precision and virtuosity.
    </h2>


    
    <h1 id="type_4">Classic Rock</h1>
    <h2 id="t_4">
      In the United States, it comprises rock music ranging generally from the mid-1960s through the mid-1990s, primarily focusing on commercially successful blues rock and hard rock 
      popularized in the 1970s AOR format. The radio format became increasingly popular with the baby boomer demographic by the end of the 1990
